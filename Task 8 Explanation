In task 8, I created a basic login form using HTML and CSS.
The HTML part contains a form with two labeled input fields: one for the username and another for the password using the type="password" attribute for security.
A Login button is also included to complete the form structure.
The CSS is used to improve the visual layout of the form. The form is centered on the webpage using Flexbox properties in the body.
