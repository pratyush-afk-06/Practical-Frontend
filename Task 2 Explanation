In Task 2, I created a webpage named task2.html to display an image along with a caption.
First, I added a heading titled “My Favorite Place” using the <h2> tag.
Then, I inserted an image using the <img> tag and included an alt attribute, which provides a text description of the image if it fails to load or for visually impaired users.
Below the image, I added a paragraph <p> describing why it is my favorite place.
